&lt;p>I recently finished reading the book &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Machina Sapiens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> by Nello Cristianini, an author I deeply admire for his expertise and ability to make complex topics related to artificial intelligence accessible. This book is not only an exploration of emerging technologies, but also a philosophical journey that fascinated me and, I must admit, a little scared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-summary-of-the-book">A Summary of the Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Machina Sapiens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> is a brilliant and provocative investigation into the ethical, social and philosophical implications of the development of artificial intelligence. Cristianini guides us through the roots of the discipline, starting from the visions of Alan Turing and arriving at modern machine learning technologies. The book analyzes how machines are progressively &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; to make decisions in ways that we cannot always understand or control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Atomic Habits | James Clear</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; by James Clear is an enlightening book that addresses the importance of habits in our daily lives.

&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-book">Summary of the Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The heart of &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; is the explanation of how small, seemingly insignificant habits can accumulate over time to produce big results. The book provides a practical structure for building good habits and breaking bad ones, based on four fundamental laws: &lt;strong>Cue, Craving, Response and Reward&lt;/strong>. These elements make up the cycle of habits, a psychological process that determines our behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guadagna con la mente |</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/mente-guadagna/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/mente-guadagna/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="comming-soon-still-reading">COMMING SOON, Still Reading&lt;/h1></description></item><item><title>guida ai bias cognitivi, Capire le Trappole della Mente | Raffaele Gaito</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/bias-cognitivi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/bias-cognitivi/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em> is a book that helps us discover and understand the mechanisms that influence our thinking and decisions. Cognitive biases are systematic errors that we all make in reasoning, often without realizing it. This book offers practical examples and ideas to recognize and address these mental traps, allowing us to improve our decision-making process.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="book-summary">Book Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em> explores how our mind simplifies reality to save energy, but at the cost of introducing distortions in reasoning. It explains why cognitive biases develop and how they affect different aspects of our lives, from everyday choices to important decisions. Among the biases covered, we find:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>il grifone | Nicola Gratteri</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/gratteri/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/gratteri/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Il Grifone&lt;/em>, written by Nicola Gratteri, is a work that goes beyond the simple narration of the fight against organized crime. This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>il vento contro | Daniele Cassioli</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/cassioli-cuore-a-vedere/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/cassioli-cuore-a-vedere/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction-the-power-to-transform-adversity-into-opportunity">Introduction, The Power to Transform Adversity into Opportunity&lt;/h2>
