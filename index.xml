&lt;p>I recently finished reading the book &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Machina Sapiens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> by Nello Cristianini, an author I deeply admire for his expertise and ability to make complex topics related to artificial intelligence accessible. This book is not only an exploration of emerging technologies, but also a philosophical journey that fascinated me and, I must admit, a little scared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-summary-of-the-book">A Summary of the Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Machina Sapiens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> is a brilliant and provocative investigation into the ethical, social and philosophical implications of the development of artificial intelligence. Cristianini guides us through the roots of the discipline, starting from the visions of Alan Turing and arriving at modern machine learning technologies. The book analyzes how machines are progressively &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; to make decisions in ways that we cannot always understand or control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wheelchair Basketball</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/basket-in-carrozzina/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/basket-in-carrozzina/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="an-experience-that-changes-your-perspective-wheelchair-basketball">An Experience That Changes Your Perspective: Wheelchair Basketball&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Human relationships are the fundamental pillar of our existence, it is no coincidence that it is said that man is a social animal&amp;hellip; Friendships, family ties and romantic relationships contribute to defining not only the quality of our life, but also who we are and what we can become.

I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/alone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/alone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="know-yourself">Know Yourself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Daniele Cassioli</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/cassioli/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/cassioli/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker.

&lt;p>Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this.

&lt;p>Humility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.

&lt;p>I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>repetition is the mother of all skills</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/repetition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/repetition/</guid><description>&lt;p>There’s a timeless truth in the saying, &lt;em>“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”&lt;/em> It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: &lt;strong>the immersion method&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature.

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; by James Clear is an enlightening book that addresses the importance of habits in our daily lives. In a clear and accessible style, the author guides us through the cycle of habits, explaining how they influence our behavior and how we can use them to improve our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-book">Summary of the Book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The heart of &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; is the explanation of how small, seemingly insignificant habits can accumulate over time to produce big results. The book provides a practical structure for building good habits and breaking bad ones, based on four fundamental laws: &lt;strong>Cue, Craving, Response and Reward&lt;/strong>. These elements make up the cycle of habits, a psychological process that determines our behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cars</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/05_passions/car/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/05_passions/car/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fueled by passion and the unforgettable roar of petrol engines, this blog is a tribute to the timeless allure of cars.

&lt;p>The &lt;em>Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em> is a book that helps us discover and understand the mechanisms that influence our thinking and decisions. Cognitive biases are systematic errors that we all make in reasoning, often without realizing it. This book offers practical examples and ideas to recognize and address these mental traps, allowing us to improve our decision-making process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em> explores how our mind simplifies reality to save energy, but at the cost of introducing distortions in reasoning.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Il Grifone&lt;/em>, written by Nicola Gratteri, is a work that goes beyond the simple narration of the fight against organized crime. This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>il vento contro | Daniele Cassioli</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/cassioli-cuore-a-vedere/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/cassioli-cuore-a-vedere/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction-the-power-to-transform-adversity-into-opportunity">Introduction, The Power to Transform Adversity into Opportunity&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Rich Dad Poor Dad&lt;/em> by Robert Kiyosaki is one of the most popular books in the world of personal finance.

&lt;p>We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-loss-of-attention-span">The Loss of Attention Span&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>think and grow rich | Napoleon Hill</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/think/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/06_books/think/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction-to-napoleon-hills-philosophy-of-success">Introduction to Napoleon Hill&amp;rsquo;s Philosophy of Success&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I was born in the little town of Rovereto, on 28 July 2003 in Italy, nestled in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. Since my earliest years, I’ve been passionate about technology, vehicles, and sports that fuel my curiosity, drive, and creativity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Growing up surrounded by the natural beauty and rich culture of Northern Italy, I found myself drawn to the mechanics of how things work, from engines to computers. My passion for technology started young and has only grown over the years, inspiring me to learn and explore more every day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Birdwatching Experience with SWAROVSKI OPTIK at Le Ali del Frassino Residence (Lake Frassino)</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/frassino/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/frassino/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/frassino/swarovski.jpeg" alt="Logo Swarovski Optik">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, thanks to my project &lt;em>Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em>, I had the chance to participate in an exclusive event organized by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy at the stunning Frassino Oasis in Peschiera del Garda.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My volunteer experience in Brazil was an unforgettable journey that led me to discover not only a country rich in culture, but also the daily challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We left in seven, a heterogeneous group composed of six strangers from different Italian cities: Verona, Padua and Rome. The experience was organized by &lt;strong>Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong>, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>21th birth Day in Brazil</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/</guid><description>&lt;p>My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/spiaggia.png" alt="Relaxing morning in Olinda beach">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountain Fauna Lover</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountain-fauna-lover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/03_projects/mountain-fauna-lover/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to MountainFaunaLover!
