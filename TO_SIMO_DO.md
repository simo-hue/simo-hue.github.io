# To Do List

## Passions Page - Verification

- [ ] **Verify Passions Page Layout**: Open `http://localhost:1313/passions/` in your browser
  - Check that the page displays 6 cards in a grid layout (Technology, Sport, Personal Growth, Content Creation, Cars, Bikes)
  - Verify each card has the correct color scheme and emoji icon
  - Test hover effects (card translation and arrow appearance)
  - Toggle dark mode and verify styling adapts correctly
  - Test responsive layout on mobile/tablet

- [ ] **Optional - Create Detail Pages**: If you want to create individual pages for each passion (e.g., `/passion/technology/`), create markdown files in `/content/english/passion/` with the appropriate frontmatter
