# To Do List

- [ ] **Define Passions**: Update your markdown content files to include the `passion` field in the frontmatter if you want them to appear in the new passion pages.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  categories: ["Sport"]
  passion: ["Sport"]
  ```
  Passion terms needed:
  - `passion/technology`
  - `passion/sport`
  - `passion/personal-growth`
  - `passion/content-creation`

- [ ] **Create Categories**: Ensure the following categories/tags exist and have content so the Passions cards are not empty when clicked:

  - `categories/technology`
  - `categories/sport`
  - `categories/personal-growth` (You may need to create these or rename existing ones like `tech-projects` or `thoughts`).
  - `categories/content-creation`
SIMO DO

- Review translated blog post `content/english/blog/thought/degree/index.md` for any nuances or typos.
