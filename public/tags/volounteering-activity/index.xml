The experience was organized by &lt;strong&gt;Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong&gt;, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>21th birth Day in Brazil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Relaxing morning in Olinda beach&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday/spiaggia.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
