        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday/olilnda.JPG" alt="Featured image of post 21th birth Day in Brazil" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made my birthday truly memorable was the surprise that my travel companions organized. They found out only a few days later that I had turned 18, and they decided to surprise me with a surprise that left me speechless. One morning we woke up at 4:30, ready to go and watch the sunrise on the beautiful Brazilian beach of Cabo Branco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what to expect. We reached the beach, the sky was starting to turn warm, a prelude to dawn. It was then that they gave me a cake, prepared especially for me. We all shared it together, eating and enjoying the sunrise in one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and then ending it in style with dinner with Don Eltom and Don Alberto who accompanied us on our volunteer experience in the Northeast of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-moment-of-pure-happiness&#34;&gt;A Moment of Pure Happiness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those moments of simplicity and friendship, I felt truly happy. It was a moment of pure connection, of gratitude towards life and towards these people who, even if they had just met, had made that day special. I realized how precious it was to step out of my patterns and embrace what is new and unexpected that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advice-from-the-heart&#34;&gt;Advice from the Heart
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can give you advice, it is to accept every experience that happens to you, even those that scare you or that seem difficult or &amp;ldquo;not made for you&amp;rdquo;. Those experiences will change you and make you grow. Getting out of your comfort zone, experiencing the world with openness and curiosity: these are the things that will give you unforgettable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That birthday away from home, in Brazil, taught me the value of sharing, friendship and adventure. It was an experience that I will always carry in my heart also with the other part of my journey there in Brazil doing volounteering activity&lt;/p&gt;
