        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli/home.png" alt="Featured image of post Daniele Cassioli" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-opportunities&#34;&gt;Gratitude for Opportunities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-daniele-cassioli-foundation&#34;&gt;The Daniele Cassioli Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is not only an athlete, but also the founder of an extraordinary reality: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.danielecassioli.it&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Daniele Cassioli Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. This organization is dedicated to supporting young people with disabilities, helping them discover and develop their potential through sports and educational activities. It is incredible to see how this foundation not only offers opportunities, but also contributes to changing society&amp;rsquo;s mentality towards disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deeper-awareness&#34;&gt;A Deeper Awareness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele made me reflect on how often, as able-bodied people, we take many things for granted. His story taught me that it is not what we lack that defines who we are, but what we develop to overcome challenges. Daniele has honed extraordinary skills, demonstrating that difficulties can become strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-fun-of-ones-flaws&#34;&gt;Making Fun of One&amp;rsquo;s Flaws
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that struck me most about Daniele is his ability to make fun of his own flaws and misfortunes. This not only makes him incredibly charismatic, but it is also a life lesson: knowing how to laugh at ourselves allows us to live with more serenity and at peace with ourselves. His light-heartedness is contagious and shows that accepting one&amp;rsquo;s limits is the first step to overcoming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;his-books-and-the-value-of-sport&#34;&gt;His Books and the Value of Sport
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is also the author of inspirational books. Among these, I read one of his texts and it struck me for the depth of his messages and the simplicity with which he manages to convey complex concepts. Furthermore, during our meeting, he underlined the importance of sport not only for physical health, but also for mental well-being and happiness. Sport is a great life teacher and a way to create authentic bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-social-role-of-great-impact&#34;&gt;A Social Role of Great Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele&amp;rsquo;s role in society is fundamental. He helps young people with disabilities to see a brighter future and not give up in the face of difficulties. In a world that tends to put labels, Daniele shows that you can live a full and fulfilling life, transmitting confidence and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-community-even-in-individual-sports&#34;&gt;The Importance of Community, Even in Individual Sports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anecdote that struck me was the story of the trips to the competitions. Although water skiing is an individual sport, Daniele described how the trips were moments of fun and community. I particularly remember the episode of the 2 athletes in wheelchairs stuck in the room and Daniele who had to resolve the situation.
He showed me that even in individual sports there is room for sharing and friendship, making the experience even richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele Cassioli was one of the most significant experiences I have ever lived, and I will carry his teachings with me. His story taught me to see life from a different perspective and to believe that difficulties are not a limit, but an opportunity to grow and live fully.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>History importance</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history/history.png" alt="Featured image of post History importance" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-from-hater-to-curious&#34;&gt;My Journey from Hater to Curious
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-the-value-of-history&#34;&gt;Discovering the Value of History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once seemed useless to me, today appears as a precious resource. Why? Because history is cyclical. Events of the past, in different forms, are still repeated today. If we look carefully, we can find surprising analogies between what happened in the past centuries and what is happening in the world today. Economic crises, social tensions, international conflicts: it seems that humanity is condemned to continually relive the same mistakes (and this makes me think a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding history has given me an additional tool to interpret the present. The more I study past events, the more I realize that it is not just a matter of memorizing dates and names, but of recognizing patterns, dynamics and cycles that recur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-from-the-mistakes-of-others&#34;&gt;Learning from the mistakes of others
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that history is not just a book of past facts, but a practical guide for the present and above all for the future. Observing how leaders of the past have moved, what decisions they have made (and what mistakes they have made), allows me to draw lessons that I can also apply in my life. I am not just talking about political or economic decisions, but also about how to deal with difficult or unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, knowing history is like having a map of the territory: it helps you orient yourself, avoid obstacles and not repeat the same mistakes made by those who came before us. Learning from the mistakes of others is a way to save time and pain, taking advantage of the wisdom accumulated over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-commitment-to-improving&#34;&gt;My commitment to improving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I try to make up for lost time, also because nowadays ignorance is a choice given that you can watch documentaries for free, listen to podcasts that delve into historical events and many other contents are available to everyone. I can&amp;rsquo;t change my school past, but I can certainly enrich my present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy process: there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by all the information I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But I don&amp;rsquo;t let myself get discouraged. Every day that passes, I discover something new that helps me better understand the world I live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who don&amp;rsquo;t know history are condemned to repeat it.” – &lt;em&gt;George Santayana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this quote, I want to remind myself (and whoever reads) that the past is not just a lesson for historians, but an opportunity for each of us to grow and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
