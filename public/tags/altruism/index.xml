      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
