      <title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-yourself&#34;&gt;Know Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-opportunities&#34;&gt;Gratitude for Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>History importance</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-from-hater-to-curious&#34;&gt;My Journey from Hater to Curious&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
