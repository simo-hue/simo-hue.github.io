&lt;p&gt;Recently, thanks to my project &lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt;, I had the chance to participate in an exclusive event organized by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy at the stunning Frassino Oasis in Peschiera del Garda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt; began almost as a joke, born from my love for mountains and wildlife. I never imagined it would open doors to such exciting collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this project, I’ve been able to experience nature up close, often alongside experts and using top-tier equipment, making each adventure more unforgettable than the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we were immersed in an extraordinary birdwatching experience with expert guidance and SWAROVSKI OPTIK’s impressive tools, including the NL X52 binoculars and the BTX spotting scope. The day began with a presentation by SWAROVSKI OPTIK Italy’s manager, Franco Cernigliaro, and ornithologist Alessandro Sartori, who introduced us to the bird species we’d encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my meeting with Franco Cernigliaro, the Country Manager of Swarovski Optik Italy, we exchanged inspiring ideas and perspectives on biodiversity and sustainability. It was a remarkable experience to engage with someone equally dedicated to nature and innovation. Our discussion centered on how these themes are fundamental to Swarovski’s mission—not just as marketing strategies but as true core values.
Swarovski Optik actively encourages deeper connections with nature and is committed to supporting sustainable practices and environmentally responsible technologies in their high-precision optics products&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation was incredible—Red-crested Pochards, Tufted Ducks, Teals, and, with a bit of luck, a Marsh Harrier—all appeared in their full beauty, enhanced by the sharpness and clarity of SWAROVSKI’s optics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has allowed me to build connections with companies like SWAROVSKI OPTIK and explore the world of wildlife in inspiring ways. Who knows what the future holds for &lt;em&gt;Mountain Fauna Lover&lt;/em&gt;… perhaps it will grow from a simple passion into something even greater. Stay tuned for more adventures!&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, where I share moments of my life, personal projects and passions. This space was born from the desire to document my experiences in an authentic and transparent way, showing you trips, adventures and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-create-simos-diary&#34;&gt;Why Did I Create Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in an era where technology allows us to capture moments in high quality simply with a smartphone. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste this opportunity! In fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to be able to record and share pieces of my life that, otherwise, would only remain in memory. With Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary, not only can I collect these memories for the future, but also share them with anyone who wants to follow them and maybe find inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-youll-find-on-simos-diary&#34;&gt;What You&amp;rsquo;ll Find on Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my channel, you&amp;rsquo;ll find content that tells the &lt;strong&gt;real life&lt;/strong&gt; of an ambitious boy, one who is ready to make sacrifices to achieve his goals. I want to show you the world without filters, far from the perfection we often see online. Through my videos, I will take you with me on journeys, challenges and everyday moments, with the aim of reminding myself and others how important it is to appreciate everything that life offers us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-themes&#34;&gt;Main Themes:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambition and Determination:&lt;/strong&gt; Simo&amp;rsquo;s Diary is also the story of a boy who wants a lot from life and is not afraid to fight to make his dreams come true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authenticity:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not interested in showing a perfect life, but rather in offering a real image of my existence, with its challenges, difficulties and not just its goals.-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal growth&lt;/strong&gt; My path and thoughts / skills that I have developed during this process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt; When a thought comes to mind, or I start a reasoning when possible I start recording so that I can then listen to myself again in the future and understand how I thought at a certain moment in my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-invitation-to-follow-your-passions&#34;&gt;An Invitation to Follow Your Passions

My hope is that my videos can push you to pursue your goals and cultivate gratitude for the little things in life without forgetting the thing that is closest to my heart lately, the fact of &lt;strong&gt;enjoying life&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore living every moment and challenge with a smile and joy because our time on this earth is very limited and it is not worth getting discouraged and living it badly.&lt;/p&gt;
