It is a real lesson in strength, determination and inclusion. Sitting in a wheelchair, picking up the ball and trying to move, shoot and collaborate with the rest of the team was enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;friendship-and-love&#34;&gt;Friendship and Love&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human relationships are the fundamental pillar of our existence, it is no coincidence that it is said that man is a social animal&amp;hellip; Friendships, family ties and romantic relationships contribute to defining not only the quality of our life, but also who we are and what we can become. We cannot ignore the enormous impact that these connections have on us, for better or for worse, and on our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-yourself&#34;&gt;Know Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-opportunities&#34;&gt;Gratitude for Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-importance-of-humility-but-without-losing-self-confidence&#34;&gt;The importance of humility, but without losing self-confidence&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/02_thought/humility/napkin-selection-4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-from-hater-to-curious&#34;&gt;My Journey from Hater to Curious&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>repetition is the mother of all skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a timeless truth in the saying, &lt;em&gt;“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”&lt;/em&gt; It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: &lt;strong&gt;the immersion method&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-immersion-method&#34;&gt;What is the Immersion Method?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature. It’s not just about repetition but also about consistency and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; by James Clear is an enlightening book that addresses the importance of habits in our daily lives. In a clear and accessible style, the author guides us through the cycle of habits, explaining how they influence our behavior and how we can use them to improve our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-book&#34;&gt;Summary of the Book&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The heart of &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; is the explanation of how small, seemingly insignificant habits can accumulate over time to produce big results. The book provides a practical structure for building good habits and breaking bad ones, based on four fundamental laws: &lt;strong&gt;Cue, Craving, Response and Reward&lt;/strong&gt;. These elements make up the cycle of habits, a psychological process that determines our behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fueled by passion and the unforgettable roar of petrol engines, this blog is a tribute to the timeless allure of cars. From a young age, I was mesmerized by the hum of engines, the thrill of watching cars fly by on the road, and the unmistakable connection I felt with each machine. Here, I dive into everything that makes cars more than just vehicles—from the technical finesse of engineering to the pure adrenaline sparked by the sound of a finely-tuned engine. Join me as I explore the art, performance, and culture of cars, where every drive feels like a shared heartbeat between driver and machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This book offers practical examples and ideas to recognize and address these mental traps, allowing us to improve our decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-summary&#34;&gt;Book Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Bias Guide&lt;/em&gt; explores how our mind simplifies reality to save energy, but at the cost of introducing distortions in reasoning. It explains why cognitive biases develop and how they affect different aspects of our lives, from everyday choices to important decisions. Among the biases covered, we find:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past, access to knowledge was a privilege. Books were scarce, universities were reserved for the elite, and expertise often required access to specialized mentors or tools. But today, the story is completely different. We live in an era where the barriers to learning have all but disappeared, thanks to the transformative power of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gift-of-unlimited-access&#34;&gt;The Gift of Unlimited Access&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internet, smartphones, and countless platforms like YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and even Wikipedia have democratized information. Want to master photography? There&amp;rsquo;s a free tutorial for that. Fascinated by astrophysics? Enroll in an online course taught by a renowned professor. Curious about coding? Interactive coding platforms and forums can turn you into a developer from the comfort of your home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the &amp;rsquo;ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beauty-of-everyday-life&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beauty of Everyday Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The 20th century Trap</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;detached-from-stimuli&#34;&gt;Detached from stimuli&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-loss-of-attention-span&#34;&gt;The Loss of Attention Span&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The experience was organized by &lt;strong&gt;Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong&gt;, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>21th birth Day in Brazil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Relaxing morning in Olinda beach&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/04_experiences/21th-birthday/spiaggia.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
