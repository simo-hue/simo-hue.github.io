        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/relationship/logo.png" alt="Featured image of post Relationship Importance" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;friendship-and-love&#34;&gt;Friendship and Love
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human relationships are the fundamental pillar of our existence, it is no coincidence that it is said that man is a social animal&amp;hellip; Friendships, family ties and romantic relationships contribute to defining not only the quality of our life, but also who we are and what we can become. We cannot ignore the enormous impact that these connections have on us, for better or for worse, and on our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-settle-aim-for-the-1&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t settle: Aim for the 1%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where too many people settle. The fear of loneliness pushes many to build relationships that do not enrich, but limit. This attitude is unacceptable in my opinion. The quality of the people you choose to have in your life can make the difference between a full life and a mediocre one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jim Rohn said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are the average of the five people you hang out with the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with the right people doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean finding just anyone, but looking for that tiny 1% that inspires you, pushes you to grow, supports you in challenges and motivates you to become the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friendship-the-value-of-sincere-support&#34;&gt;Friendship: The value of sincere support
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A true friend is not just a companion for laughter, but also a partner in personal growth and the support you know you can count on in the darkest and most difficult moments. The best friends are those who are not afraid to confront you with your mistakes, to encourage you when necessary and to celebrate your successes with you. Choosing friends who share your values ​​and aspirations is not always easy, but it is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Seneca said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A friend is someone who wants for you what he wants for himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful who you trust. Not everyone who seems like a friend is really one, and not everyone has the courage or the ability to support you in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-relationships-building-not-limiting&#34;&gt;Love Relationships: Building, Not Limiting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a partner is perhaps one of the most important decisions in our lives. The person you choose to share your time and emotions with has the power to determine your destiny. A healthy and authentic relationship is one that enriches you, pushes you to new heights, and creates a safe space for your personal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not the lack of love, but the lack of friendship that makes marriages unhappy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t settle for someone just because you’re afraid of being alone. Have the courage to wait for that person who not only completes your life, but elevates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-choose-wisely&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Choose Wisely
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is too short to waste it on the wrong people. Every relationship you choose should be a conscious choice, not a fallback. Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, who support you in difficult times, and who share your vision of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to think about who you want in your circle. It’s not easy, but it’s one of the most important decisions you can make. As Aristotle said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In poverty and other adversities of life, true friends are a safe refuge. The young who love and the old who are loved are the greatest comforts we can have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: It’s not just about company, it’s about quality. Choose the 1% in all areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spread Love wherever you go</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/love/image.png" alt="Featured image of post Spread Love wherever you go" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember with particular affection an episode that happened during a visit to a museum in Palermo. As I was leaving, I greeted the ticket inspector who was near the door. He seemed surprised and thanked me with sincere gratitude. He said, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You were the only one who greeted me among those who came out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Those words struck a chord with me. It was such a simple gesture, almost automatic for me, but for him it made a difference. It reminded me of how powerful a small kindness can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I believe the world needs more love and kindness. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect grand gestures to make a difference; often it&amp;rsquo;s the simplest actions that leave a mark. As Mother Teresa said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not start today? Spread love wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/alone/alone.png" alt="Featured image of post The importance of being able to stay alone" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-yourself&#34;&gt;Know Yourself
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-free-from-social-pressure&#34;&gt;Break Free from Social Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not normal, nor necessary, to always be surrounded by people. We often feel obliged to be part of groups or situations that do not represent us, just for fear of being judged. Learning to be alone helps us break free from this social pressure. There is nothing wrong with taking time for yourself, saying no to things that don’t make you feel good, and reclaiming your independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;becoming-independent-and-strong&#34;&gt;Becoming Independent and Strong
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we learn to be comfortable alone, we become stronger. We no longer need to constantly lean on others to find security or happiness. This doesn’t mean closing ourselves off from the world, but being independent, knowing that our inner strength is enough to face life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harnessing-the-value-of-solitude&#34;&gt;Harnessing the Value of Solitude
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is fertile ground for creativity and reflection. When we give ourselves time to be alone, thoughts and ideas often emerge that we would never have had otherwise. However, these moments must be lived consciously. If we let ourselves be overwhelmed by negative stimuli, such as excessive use of social media, we risk turning solitude into isolation and, in the worst cases, depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of solitude, we must live it with intention: reading a good book, meditating, walking in nature or simply reflecting on ourselves. These moments can be incredibly regenerating and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solitude-as-a-gym-for-growth&#34;&gt;Solitude as a Gym for Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is not an enemy, but an opportunity. It is a space that allows us to grow, to become more aware and to strengthen our independence. As Rainer Maria Rilke wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solitude is like rain: it rises from the sea towards the evening, from distant and remote plains, it rises to the sky, which always possesses it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking time for ourselves is a gift we can give ourselves, every day. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of being alone: ​​that&amp;rsquo;s where you could discover the best version of yourself&amp;hellip;but I would also like to remind you that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is able to do it, but you must be one of them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Daniele Cassioli</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/cassioli/home.png" alt="Featured image of post Daniele Cassioli" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-opportunities&#34;&gt;Gratitude for Opportunities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-daniele-cassioli-foundation&#34;&gt;The Daniele Cassioli Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is not only an athlete, but also the founder of an extraordinary reality: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.danielecassioli.it&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Daniele Cassioli Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. This organization is dedicated to supporting young people with disabilities, helping them discover and develop their potential through sports and educational activities. It is incredible to see how this foundation not only offers opportunities, but also contributes to changing society&amp;rsquo;s mentality towards disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deeper-awareness&#34;&gt;A Deeper Awareness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele made me reflect on how often, as able-bodied people, we take many things for granted. His story taught me that it is not what we lack that defines who we are, but what we develop to overcome challenges. Daniele has honed extraordinary skills, demonstrating that difficulties can become strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-fun-of-ones-flaws&#34;&gt;Making Fun of One&amp;rsquo;s Flaws
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that struck me most about Daniele is his ability to make fun of his own flaws and misfortunes. This not only makes him incredibly charismatic, but it is also a life lesson: knowing how to laugh at ourselves allows us to live with more serenity and at peace with ourselves. His light-heartedness is contagious and shows that accepting one&amp;rsquo;s limits is the first step to overcoming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;his-books-and-the-value-of-sport&#34;&gt;His Books and the Value of Sport
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele is also the author of inspirational books. Among these, I read one of his texts and it struck me for the depth of his messages and the simplicity with which he manages to convey complex concepts. Furthermore, during our meeting, he underlined the importance of sport not only for physical health, but also for mental well-being and happiness. Sport is a great life teacher and a way to create authentic bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-social-role-of-great-impact&#34;&gt;A Social Role of Great Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniele&amp;rsquo;s role in society is fundamental. He helps young people with disabilities to see a brighter future and not give up in the face of difficulties. In a world that tends to put labels, Daniele shows that you can live a full and fulfilling life, transmitting confidence and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-community-even-in-individual-sports&#34;&gt;The Importance of Community, Even in Individual Sports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anecdote that struck me was the story of the trips to the competitions. Although water skiing is an individual sport, Daniele described how the trips were moments of fun and community. I particularly remember the episode of the 2 athletes in wheelchairs stuck in the room and Daniele who had to resolve the situation.
He showed me that even in individual sports there is room for sharing and friendship, making the experience even richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Daniele Cassioli was one of the most significant experiences I have ever lived, and I will carry his teachings with me. His story taught me to see life from a different perspective and to believe that difficulties are not a limit, but an opportunity to grow and live fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave the live of the event here&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/humility/image.png" alt="Featured image of post Don&#39;t Brag" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-importance-of-humility-but-without-losing-self-confidence&#34;&gt;The importance of humility, but without losing self-confidence
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-humility-becomes-a-limit&#34;&gt;When humility becomes a limit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is an insidious risk that hides behind excessive humility. While on the one hand it can be a sign of maturity and wisdom, on the other it can turn into a trap that undermines self-confidence. Being excessively humble can lead to underestimating one&amp;rsquo;s abilities, to belittling one&amp;rsquo;s successes or even to avoiding opportunities for fear of not being &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; to face them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where comparing ourselves to others is the order of the day, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that humility means self-deprecation or extreme modesty. But being humble does not mean belittling yourself, but rather recognizing your limits without losing sight of your strengths. Humility must coexist with a healthy dose of self-esteem.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultivating-a-balance-humility-and-self-confidence&#34;&gt;Cultivating a balance: Humility and Self-Confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal balance consists of recognizing your own value without falling into arrogance. We can be aware of our skills, celebrating successes with gratitude but without turning them into vanity. We must learn to recognize what we have achieved without feeling superior to others, but also without belittling our path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this balance, it is useful to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;Am I rejecting this recognition because I am truly humble, or because I do not believe in myself enough?&amp;rdquo; Cultivating self-confidence does not mean becoming arrogant, but having the awareness of your own abilities to confidently face challenges and goals.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humility and self-confidence are not conflicting qualities, but two sides of the same coin. Being humble keeps us grounded in reality, but having self-confidence pushes us to dream bigger and face challenges without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Humility does not consist in thinking less of yourself, but in thinking less of yourself.” – &lt;em&gt;C.S. Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>History importance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/history/history.png" alt="Featured image of post History importance" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-from-hater-to-curious&#34;&gt;My Journey from Hater to Curious
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-the-value-of-history&#34;&gt;Discovering the Value of History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once seemed useless to me, today appears as a precious resource. Why? Because history is cyclical. Events of the past, in different forms, are still repeated today. If we look carefully, we can find surprising analogies between what happened in the past centuries and what is happening in the world today. Economic crises, social tensions, international conflicts: it seems that humanity is condemned to continually relive the same mistakes (and this makes me think a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding history has given me an additional tool to interpret the present. The more I study past events, the more I realize that it is not just a matter of memorizing dates and names, but of recognizing patterns, dynamics and cycles that recur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-from-the-mistakes-of-others&#34;&gt;Learning from the mistakes of others
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that history is not just a book of past facts, but a practical guide for the present and above all for the future. Observing how leaders of the past have moved, what decisions they have made (and what mistakes they have made), allows me to draw lessons that I can also apply in my life. I am not just talking about political or economic decisions, but also about how to deal with difficult or unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, knowing history is like having a map of the territory: it helps you orient yourself, avoid obstacles and not repeat the same mistakes made by those who came before us. Learning from the mistakes of others is a way to save time and pain, taking advantage of the wisdom accumulated over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-commitment-to-improving&#34;&gt;My commitment to improving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I try to make up for lost time, also because nowadays ignorance is a choice given that you can watch documentaries for free, listen to podcasts that delve into historical events and many other contents are available to everyone. I can&amp;rsquo;t change my school past, but I can certainly enrich my present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy process: there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by all the information I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But I don&amp;rsquo;t let myself get discouraged. Every day that passes, I discover something new that helps me better understand the world I live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who don&amp;rsquo;t know history are condemned to repeat it.” – &lt;em&gt;George Santayana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this quote, I want to remind myself (and whoever reads) that the past is not just a lesson for historians, but an opportunity for each of us to grow and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>repetition is the mother of all skills</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/repetition/i.png" alt="Featured image of post repetition is the mother of all skills" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a timeless truth in the saying, &lt;em&gt;“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”&lt;/em&gt; It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: &lt;strong&gt;the immersion method&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-immersion-method&#34;&gt;What is the Immersion Method?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature. It’s not just about repetition but also about consistency and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I applied it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I made sure to interact with the concepts every single day. Whether it was listening to a podcast, reading a book, taking notes, or even talking about it with others, I created a constant feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Repetition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instead of passively consuming material, I actively revisited it. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reread the same books multiple times. Each read revealed something I missed the first time or offered new insights as my understanding deepened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I rewrote my notes. This process helped reinforce the key points in my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Immersion wasn’t just theoretical. I put what I learned into practice in real-world scenarios, which solidified the knowledge in my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-subconscious-absorption-to-visible-results&#34;&gt;From Subconscious Absorption to Visible Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most incredible change I experienced was seeing how concepts that once felt elusive started to flow naturally. It’s as if they had seeped into my subconscious. I no longer had to think so hard to recall them; they were just &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, while studying personal development topics, I found that principles I’d been exposed to for weeks suddenly became part of my decision-making process. I didn’t have to remind myself to “stay present” or “focus on the process” anymore—it just happened. This transformation wasn’t magic; it was immersion at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-repetition-is-crucial&#34;&gt;Why Repetition is Crucial
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repetition isn’t boring; it’s foundational. Every time you revisit a concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;strengthen the neural pathways&lt;/strong&gt; in your brain, making recall faster and easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see new perspectives that weren’t apparent the first time. A single read-through of a book or course can’t uncover all its wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned about the power of repetition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books are meant to be reread.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of my favorite books have been revisited three or four times, and each time I gain new insights or reinforce old ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning never stops.&lt;/strong&gt; What seems redundant often turns out to be the foundation for mastery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-impact-of-immersion-on-me&#34;&gt;The Impact of Immersion on Me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immersion method has had a profound effect on my growth, both personally and professionally. Not only have I seen results in terms of knowledge retention, but also in how I think and act. Concepts that I struggled to grasp now feel second nature, and my confidence has skyrocketed because I trust in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts-repetition-as-a-way-of-life&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts: Repetition as a Way of Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with novelty, we often undervalue repetition. But true mastery isn’t about skimming through countless books or ideas; it’s about deeply understanding and integrating a few. Immersion and repetition are how you turn knowledge into action and action into habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let me leave you with this:&lt;br&gt;
Revisit that book you love. Redo that course you enjoyed. Practice that skill over and over. You might be surprised by how much growth lies in going &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt;, not wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on repetition and immersion? Have you tried applying these principles to your learning or personal growth? Share your experiences below!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ignorance nowadays is a choice</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/ignorance-today/al.png" alt="Featured image of post ignorance nowadays is a choice" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, access to knowledge was a privilege. Books were scarce, universities were reserved for the elite, and expertise often required access to specialized mentors or tools. But today, the story is completely different. We live in an era where the barriers to learning have all but disappeared, thanks to the transformative power of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gift-of-unlimited-access&#34;&gt;The Gift of Unlimited Access
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet, smartphones, and countless platforms like YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and even Wikipedia have democratized information. Want to master photography? There&amp;rsquo;s a free tutorial for that. Fascinated by astrophysics? Enroll in an online course taught by a renowned professor. Curious about coding? Interactive coding platforms and forums can turn you into a developer from the comfort of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented access means that anyone with a genuine passion and determination can become an expert in virtually any field. The tools are there, waiting to be used. Ignorance, in many ways, is no longer an excuse. It has become a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge-information-overload&#34;&gt;The Challenge: Information Overload
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with great access comes great responsibility. The same internet that empowers us is also flooded with misinformation, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Separating valuable, accurate knowledge from noise has become a skill in itself. Critical thinking and a skeptical eye are essential for navigating this sea of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re learning from reliable sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the credentials&lt;/strong&gt; of the author or creator. Are they an expert in the field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-reference information&lt;/strong&gt; across multiple reputable sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for peer-reviewed or fact-checked content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of biases&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in sensational or overly opinionated materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-self-education&#34;&gt;The Future of Self-Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to evolve, so will the tools for self-education. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality are already shaping the way we learn, making it more interactive and immersive. But one thing remains constant: the drive to learn must come from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the resources at our fingertips and being mindful of the content we consume, we can unlock boundless potential. The only question left is: what will you choose to learn today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.&amp;rdquo; – B.B. King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Life Appreciation</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/gratitude/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/gratitude/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/gratitude/grateful.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Life Appreciation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beauty-of-everyday-life&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beauty of Everyday Life&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The simplest things, often the quietest, are those that resonate most within us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-for-health-and-relationships&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude for Health and Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is one of the most precious gifts we possess and that we usually tend to notice only when it is lacking. Practicing gratitude for our body and its ability to allow us to live and experience is a first step towards a deeper appreciation of ourselves and life. Relationships, whether they are family or friends, give us the opportunity to feel understood, supported and loved. And this too is never a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-power-of-nature-sunsets-the-sun-and-the-cycle-of-the-seasons&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Nature: Sunsets, the Sun and the Cycle of the Seasons&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural world is full of beauty and wonder, and just taking a few minutes to observe it can instantly make you feel more serene and grounded. Watching a sunset, feeling the wind on your skin, or perceiving the warmth of the sun helps us reconnect to the present and appreciate the simplicity of life. These moments do not require money or status; they are there, every day, for anyone who wants to stop and experience them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-journey-of-gratitude-a-growth-path&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Journey of Gratitude: A Growth Path&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to these thoughts thanks to some personal growth courses that I took. In particular, one of the courses that had a significant impact on me was &lt;em&gt;Optimism and Resilience&lt;/em&gt; by Nicoletta Stella, which I attended during my time at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona. This course helped me develop a more open and resilient mindset, making me understand how important it is to appreciate every aspect of life, even in difficult moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude-practices-in-daily-life&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude Practices in Daily Life&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who wants to start practicing gratitude, here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a gratitude journal&lt;/strong&gt;: Every day, write down three things you are grateful for. They can be simple, like the food you ate or a pleasant conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop and reflect&lt;/strong&gt;: Every time you feel a positive emotion, try to stop and live it fully, without thinking about what comes after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expressing Gratitude to Others&lt;/strong&gt;: Saying “thank you” to someone or letting them know how much they mean to you can improve not only your mood, but also the bond between you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life as a Gift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion living appreciating what you have doesn’t mean not trying to improve yourself or reach new goals. It means remembering that every moment has a value and that we are part of a unique and unrepeatable experience. Being grateful for everyday things – from the bonds with those we love to the simple pleasures of nature – helps us cultivate a fuller and more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciating life means finding beauty even in simple moments, welcoming every moment as a gift, and recognizing that true happiness comes from gratitude for what we already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The 20th century Trap</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/02_thought/trap/traps.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The 20th century Trap" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;detached-from-stimuli&#34;&gt;Detached from stimuli
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-loss-of-attention-span&#34;&gt;The Loss of Attention Span
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-incredibly-addicted-generation&#34;&gt;An Incredibly Addicted Generation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference compared to when I was a child. I remember with nostalgia the time spent playing outside, running in the parks and socializing with friends. Now I see parents who have to force their children to go out because, as soon as they can, young people prefer to stay sunk on the couch, immersed in devices. This cultural change is fueled by social media, which offers continuous doses of dopamine pleasure, generating an addiction similar to that of chemical substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-step-awareness&#34;&gt;First Step: Awareness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to free ourselves from this trap is to gain awareness. It is essential to understand how much social media and digital devices can suck us into their network, distancing us from real life and its most natural and authentic stimuli. If not managed with awareness, these tools can make us slaves to a virtual reality, making us lose connection with ourselves and with others in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-being-bored&#34;&gt;The Importance of Being Bored
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being bored has become almost a taboo in modern society, but it is a practice that brings incredible benefits. Being bored is an opportunity to reflect, to let your mind wander and to reconnect with your creativity. It is a state that can bring out deep thoughts and new ideas, a precious space in which the mind frees itself from incessant stimuli and learns to regenerate itself. Learning to enjoy the absence of stimuli is essential to regaining our attention and living a more balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you feel the temptation to grab your phone during a break, try to resist. Let your mind free itself from the need for constant stimuli, embrace boredom and allow yourself to return to a more natural rhythm. This is the only way we can escape the &amp;ldquo;Social Trap&amp;rdquo; and regain our mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
