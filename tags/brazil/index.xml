&lt;p>My volunteer experience in Brazil was an unforgettable journey that led me to discover not only a country rich in culture, but also the daily challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We left in seven, a heterogeneous group composed of six strangers from different Italian cities: Verona, Padua and Rome. The experience was organized by &lt;strong>Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza&lt;/strong>, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>21th birth Day in Brazil</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/04_experiences/21th-birthday/</guid><description>&lt;p>My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
