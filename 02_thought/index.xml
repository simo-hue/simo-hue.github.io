&lt;p>Human relationships are the fundamental pillar of our existence, it is no coincidence that it is said that man is a social animal&amp;hellip; Friendships, family ties and romantic relationships contribute to defining not only the quality of our life, but also who we are and what we can become. We cannot ignore the enormous impact that these connections have on us, for better or for worse, and on our lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spread Love wherever you go</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/love.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/love.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of being able to stay alone</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/alone.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/alone.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="know-yourself">Know Yourself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Solitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Daniele Cassioli</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/cassioli.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/cassioli.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I had the privilege of meeting Daniele Cassioli, and I can say that it was a deeply enriching experience. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know him, Daniele is a blind Paralympic athlete, world champion in water skiing, author and motivational speaker. His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gratitude-for-opportunities">Gratitude for Opportunities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Being a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't Brag</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/humility.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/humility.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-importance-of-humility-but-without-losing-self-confidence">The importance of humility, but without losing self-confidence&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Humility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.

&lt;p>I admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>repetition is the mother of all skills</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/repetition.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/repetition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>There’s a timeless truth in the saying, &lt;em>“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”&lt;/em> It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: &lt;strong>the immersion method&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-immersion-method">What is the Immersion Method?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature. It’s not just about repetition but also about consistency and engagement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ignorance nowadays is a choice</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/ignorance-today.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/ignorance-today.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In the past, access to knowledge was a privilege. Books were scarce, universities were reserved for the elite, and expertise often required access to specialized mentors or tools. But today, the story is completely different. We live in an era where the barriers to learning have all but disappeared, thanks to the transformative power of technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gift-of-unlimited-access">The Gift of Unlimited Access&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The internet, smartphones, and countless platforms like YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and even Wikipedia have democratized information. Want to master photography? There&amp;rsquo;s a free tutorial for that. Fascinated by astrophysics? Enroll in an online course taught by a renowned professor. Curious about coding? Interactive coding platforms and forums can turn you into a developer from the comfort of your home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Life Appreciation</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/gratitude.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/gratitude.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The 20th century Trap</title><link>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/trap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:31:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://simo-hue.github.io/02_thought/trap.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="detached-from-stimuli">Detached from stimuli&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly &amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-loss-of-attention-span">The Loss of Attention Span&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of &amp;ldquo;directors&amp;rdquo; of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
