**DeepSafe** is a revolutionary Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to democratize AI Safety education through **gamification**. By borrowing addictive mechanics from apps like Duolingo, we turn the dry task of learning about phishing, deepfakes, and prompt injection into an exciting "Cyber-Guardian" adventure.

## The Mission

In an era where AI threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, traditional cybersecurity training is often boring and ineffective. DeepSafe changes the narrative. Our goal is to make learning **engaging, accessible, and rewarding** for everyone.

## Key Features

### 🇮🇹 The Campaign: A Journey Through Italy
Forget boring lists of modules. DeepSafe features a **non-linear interactive map** of Italy with 20 regions and over 100 provinces.
-   **Regional Challenges**: Unlocking a region like Lombardy might present financial fraud scenarios, while Lazio focuses on government data security.
-   **Visual Progression**: The map comes alive, with provinces glowing Gold (Mastered) or Cyan (Passed) based on your performance.

### 🎮 Gamification Core
We implemented a robust game loop to keep users coming back:
-   **Lives System**: You have 5 hearts. Make a mistake? Lose a heart. It adds stakes to every quiz.
-   **Streaks**: Daily login streaks build a habit of learning.
-   **NeuroCredits (NC)**: Earn currency by completing missions to spend in the **Black Market**.

### 🎨 Cyber-Guardian Aesthetic
The UI is built with a "Glassmorphism" design language, featuring neon accents, dark modes, and smooth framer-motion animations. It feels like a premium sci-fi interface, not a corporate training tool.

### 🛒 The Black Market & Shop
A fully integrated economy where users can spend their hard-earned NeuroCredits or purchase boosters via **Stripe**.

## Tech Stack: Bleeding Edge

DeepSafe pushes the boundaries of modern web development:
-   **Framework**: **Next.js 16** (Canary) & **React 19**, utilizing the latest React Server Components and Server Actions.
-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v4** for high-performance styling.
-   **Backend**: **Supabase** for Auth, Database, and Realtime subscriptions.
-   **Mobile**: **Capacitor** integration allows the app to be installed as a native iOS and Android app.
