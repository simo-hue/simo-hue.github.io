## The Genesis of the Project: From a Passion for Security to Sharing

Professor Davide Quaglia's **Programming and Network Security** course was much more than a simple university exam for me. It was an opportunity to delve deeper into a field that deeply fascinates me: **cybersecurity** and **network technologies**.

From the very first lessons, I realized that this topic required both a theoretical and an intensely practical approach. Many of my classmates struggled to connect theoretical concepts with real-world implementations, often getting lost in socket programming, network protocols, and traffic analysis.

## From Shared Difficulty to Collaborative Solution

Observing my colleagues' difficulties, I decided to transform my study program into a **shared resource for the entire student community**. The idea was simple yet ambitious: to create a comprehensive collection of materials that could help anyone approach this exam with greater confidence.

It wasn't just about sharing notes, but about building a complete educational ecosystem with:
- Practical, commented code
- Working examples
- Clear documentation
- Analysis of real-world cases

## Structure and Content of the Educational Project
