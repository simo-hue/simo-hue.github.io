## The Genesis of the Project: From a Spontaneous Idea to a Professional Solution

It all started very naturally. Some friends run a small e-bike rental shop and found themselves dealing daily with handwritten reservations, inventory management with Excel spreadsheets, and an unclear view of their earnings and business performance.

One day, observing their difficulties, I thought, "Why not create something simple yet functional that could really help them?" The idea was to quickly develop a prototype using **Lovable** for the basic structure, something that could be immediately usable.

## From Prototype to Refined Solution

What was initially intended to be a simple help for friends turned into something much more ambitious. After creating the initial structure with Lovable, I realized the project's potential and decided to **completely refine** it to make it a professional solution that could also be used locally.

The transition from a web prototype to a local desktop application was motivated by several needs:
- **Data privacy**: No sensitive data is sent online
- **Independence**: Works even without an internet connection
- **Total control**: The shop owner has full control over their data
- **Zero costs**: No monthly subscriptions or recurring costs

## Main Technical Features

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite (local)
- **Architecture**: Fully offline desktop application

### Core Features

#### üóìÔ∏è Advanced Booking System
- **Interactive calendar** for viewing reservations
- **Real-time e-bike availability tracking**
- **Flexible categories**: hourly, half-day, full-day
- **Management Statuses**: confirmed, pending, completed, canceled

#### üö≤ Virtual Garage and Inventory
- **Complete tracking** of every single bicycle
- **Support for multiple e-bike types** and sizes
