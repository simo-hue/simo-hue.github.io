# 🚀 Redevelopment of the Rocca di Nogarole: Our Journey with CLab Verona

The journey of the **Contamination Lab (CLab)** at the University of Verona was much more than a simple project: it was an adventure, an exciting challenge that allowed my team and I to explore new skills, tackle real obstacles, and above all, create concrete ideas for our community.

## 🌿 Our Goal: Revitalize the Rocca di Nogarole

The heart of our challenge was to propose innovative ideas to redevelop the splendid and historic Rocca di Nogarole. A symbolic monument, rich in history, it deserved to be enhanced and revived as a cultural, social, and tourism center, bringing tangible benefits to the local community.

## 💡 The Journey: Growth, Innovation, and Collaboration

During this journey, we had the opportunity to attend targeted workshops, brainstorming sessions led by qualified mentors, and meetings with experts from various fields. The CLab taught us not only how to work as a team, but also how to think "outside the box," tackling real-world problems with creativity and pragmatism.

In this article, you will find:

- 📚 The training materials provided to us during the project
- 🛠️ All the materials produced by our team during the project (presentations, documents, analyses, etc.)
