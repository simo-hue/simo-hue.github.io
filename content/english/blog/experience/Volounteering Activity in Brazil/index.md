## Introduction

![Don Mazza Logo](don-mazza-pia.jpg)

My volunteer experience in Brazil was an unforgettable journey that led me to discover not only a country rich in culture, but also the daily challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations.

We left in seven, a heterogeneous group composed of six strangers from different Italian cities: Verona, Padua and Rome. The experience was organized by **Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza**, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.

## The Cities Visited

During our stay, we had the opportunity to explore different areas of Brazil, focusing mainly on Recife and João Pessoa, the largest cities we visited, before heading inland to Zumbi and Itapororoca. These cities are a vibrant mix of culture, history and traditions, but also of social challenges that have deeply affected us since our arrival.

## Significant Moments

It would be impossible to remember them all since the experience was characterized by moments of joy and just as many of emotional difficulty.

One of the most touching memories was when we distributed food to people in need, an act that made us realize the critical reality in which many communities lived.

We also visited the communities of **Olinda** and **Alto do Mateus**, where we saw up close the precarious living conditions of the local people.

## Itapororoca Vibes

In Itapororoca, we were hosted by an extraordinary family who dedicated their lives to creating a school and providing aid to the local community.

We had the opportunity to meet each member of their family, wonderful people who welcomed us with unprecedented openness and hospitality, which deeply touched me.

The moment of saying goodbye was extremely difficult, as the bond that had been created was sincere and deep.

Fortunately, thanks to technology, we are still able to stay in touch, sharing moments and memories that unite us despite the distance.

## Beira da Linha Project

![Beira da Linha Project with child](beiraTogether.jpeg)

Without a doubt, my favorite project was **Beira da Linha**. Here we assisted teachers in their lessons and I had the opportunity to interact with children and young people who attended after-school activities.

These young people, coming from difficult backgrounds, aspired to a better future, and my bond with them was extraordinary. The possibility of contributing to their educational journey was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

And my greatest respect goes to these educators who dedicate their lives to improving that of the new generations

During our stay there, as a tradition in Brazil, we played football a lot...but the difference was that we were all playing barefoot on the concrete since they only had one pair of shoes, or sometimes not even those and therefore they couldn't/didn't want to ruin them

## A Unique Group

The group with which I shared this adventure was also fantastic.

We hit it off right away, creating bonds that made the experience even more unique and I really have to thank you Noemi, Federica, Maristella, Andrea, Rachid for the amazing experience that we've made.

Back home, I can finally reflect on what I experienced and assimilate the messages and lessons learned. 

Three months have passed since I returned, but the emotions and experiences I lived in Brazil continue to influence my daily life.

We shared so much in only three weeks and when it comes to my mind it seems like a film...too good to be true

## Contribution to Projects / Mazzian Ideals

I have actively participated in volunteer projects organized by **Collegio Don Mazza**, with particular attention to education and social support initiatives.

During this experience, I collaborated on projects aimed at improving the socio-educational conditions of children and adolescents in disadvantaged areas, including after-school activities, creative and sports workshops, and literacy programs. I also had the opportunity to contribute to social inclusion and the promotion of the psychophysical well-being of young people, working in an intercultural exchange context that enriched my relational and organizational skills.

## Soft Skills Development

This experience has allowed me to develop important soft skills such as teamwork, leadership and problem solving skills. The daily challenges and the need to adapt to a new reality have taught me to collaborate effectively with others and to look for innovative solutions.

## Conclusion

My volunteering experience in Brazil has been a journey of personal and professional growth that I would invite anyone to do, as I recommended during the seminars/meetings of presentation and testimony of the experience that I held together with my fellow adventurers in Rome, Padua and Verona.

I would conclude with a phrase that **Nelson Mandela** once said:

> "Education is the most powerful weapon you can use."

This phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of my journey and the meaning of the work we have done and the message that I tried to pass on to these young Brazilians. I hope to continue to carry forward the teachings of this experience and to contribute to the improvement of people's lives, wherever I am.
