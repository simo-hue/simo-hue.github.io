# An Experience That Changes Your Perspective: Wheelchair Basketball

Thanks to the extraordinary collaboration between **Collegio Don Mazza**, **Residenza Ferrari delle Spade di Verona** and **Olympic Basket Verona**, I had the opportunity to live one of the most significant experiences of my life: trying **wheelchair basketball**.

## A unique experience

This discipline goes far beyond a simple game. It is a real lesson in strength, determination and inclusion. Sitting in a wheelchair, picking up the ball and trying to move, shoot and collaborate with the rest of the team was enlightening.

I learned that sport is a universal language, capable of breaking down all types of barriers ‚Äì physical, mental and cultural. It was an opportunity to see the world from a completely different perspective, to recognize the daily challenges that many athletes face and to appreciate their commitment and resilience.

## Sport as a driver of inspiration

As Nelson Mandela said:
> *‚ÄúSport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people like few other things in the world.‚Äù*

This is exactly what I felt during this experience. Sport is a powerful tool to overcome limits and to build authentic bonds with those around us.

Another phrase that strongly resonates with this experience is that of John Wooden:
> *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let what you can‚Äôt do get in the way of what you can do.‚Äù*

Wheelchair basketball shows that with passion, determination and team spirit there are no insurmountable obstacles.
