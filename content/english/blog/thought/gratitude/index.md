We often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.

## **The Beauty of Everyday Life**

Being grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.

> “The simplest things, often the quietest, are those that resonate most within us.”

## **Gratitude for Health and Relationships**

Health is one of the most precious gifts we possess and that we usually tend to notice only when it is lacking. Practicing gratitude for our body and its ability to allow us to live and experience is a first step towards a deeper appreciation of ourselves and life. Relationships, whether they are family or friends, give us the opportunity to feel understood, supported and loved. And this too is never a given.

## **The Power of Nature: Sunsets, the Sun and the Cycle of the Seasons**

The natural world is full of beauty and wonder, and just taking a few minutes to observe it can instantly make you feel more serene and grounded. Watching a sunset, feeling the wind on your skin, or perceiving the warmth of the sun helps us reconnect to the present and appreciate the simplicity of life. These moments do not require money or status; they are there, every day, for anyone who wants to stop and experience them.

## **The Journey of Gratitude: A Growth Path**

I came to these thoughts thanks to some personal growth courses that I took. In particular, one of the courses that had a significant impact on me was *Optimism and Resilience* by Nicoletta Stella, which I attended during my time at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona. This course helped me develop a more open and resilient mindset, making me understand how important it is to appreciate every aspect of life, even in difficult moments.

## **Gratitude Practices in Daily Life**

For anyone who wants to start practicing gratitude, here are some practical tips:

- **Write a gratitude journal**: Every day, write down three things you are grateful for. They can be simple, like the food you ate or a pleasant conversation.
- **Stop and reflect**: Every time you feel a positive emotion, try to stop and live it fully, without thinking about what comes after.
- **Expressing Gratitude to Others**: Saying “thank you” to someone or letting them know how much they mean to you can improve not only your mood, but also the bond between you.

Life as a Gift

In conclusion living appreciating what you have doesn’t mean not trying to improve yourself or reach new goals. It means remembering that every moment has a value and that we are part of a unique and unrepeatable experience. Being grateful for everyday things – from the bonds with those we love to the simple pleasures of nature – helps us cultivate a fuller and more satisfying life.
