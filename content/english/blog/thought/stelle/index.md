## Context

I was reading the book "Insegna al cuore a vedere" by Daniele Cassioli and I came across a sentence that made me reflect.

> Stars can only be seen in the dark.

## The Issue

It is true that to many it might seem like a banality or to some even something meaningless... a waste of time.

## My Situation

It is a very difficult and complex period... Problems in the relationship with my partner (since about 1 month) that really take away a lot of mental energy from me and consequently also lead to a lack of focus.

And then also the fact that I am in "my gap year" and I am figuring out what I want to do with my life:
- start working
- continue with studies

It seems simple, and trivial problems (which in reality they are... in the sense that they are privileged problems) but they cause me a lot of stress and panic attacks (even if I have never talked about it with anyone).

## My Interpretation

From here, perhaps because I am effectively in a dark period of my life, I interpreted this sentence as if it were a message for me.

The fact that the darkness represents a difficult period of life in which one can certainly (like most people) get down and feel sorry for themselves, or also look at the other side of the coin.

From here in fact, my curiosity to understand what good there is in this down period... seeing that the last dark period of my life I had when my previous relationship ended (badly).
I must say that from that period I came out not with my head held high, more, and all that suffering and desire for redemption, to demonstrate my value to the world, really transformed me...

Will it be like this this time too? This I don't know... but the only thing I can say is that even if everything seems to be going wrong I want to strive to always try to see the glass half full to be able to improve/grow even from this situation here. Obviously, if I could choose I would have avoided living this situation, but it presented itself and so one must "fight it" to see what it has come to bring me.

> It won't be easy at all eh... but one can do nothing else but face it with all the possible and imaginable strength to not be overwhelmed by it.
