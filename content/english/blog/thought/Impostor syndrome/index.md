## Definitions

### Impostor Sindrome
La sindrome dell'impostore è uno stato psicologico in cui una persona, pur avendo raggiunto dei successi, non li considera frutto delle proprie capacità, ma di fortuna o fattori esterni, vivendo con la costante paura di essere scoperta come incompetente e inadeguata. Chi soffre di questa sindrome sminuisce le proprie abilità, dubita della propria competenza e si sente colpevole dei propri traguardi, temendo il giudizio e il fallimento. 


### Ignorance
1. Inconsapevolezza o incompetenza (più o meno colpevole).
2. Condizione determinata dalla mancanza di istruzione o di educazione.

With this said we can start...

I'm really struggling to "categorize" myself and figure out whether I'm ignorant or extremely affected by impostor syndrome.

## The Hard Truth Of Being Ambitius

If you know me or have read a few articles on my blog, you'll already know that I'm a very ambitious person, hence the need to become "THE BEST VERSION OF MYSELF" (even if that's an overused term these days).

To become that, I have to sacrifice a lot...if NOT everything, to acquire as many skills (useful and marketable) as possible in the shortest possible time.

Often, however, like right now, with about 10 days to go until my graduation, I feel like I have no skills at all (even though I've actually been pursuing university with perseverance, commitment, and even satisfaction).

## What About The Peers?

Social comparison destroys me, between social media like LinkedIn, where it seems everyone is working and getting accepted for internships (something I'm actively seeking, with no results so far after hundreds of applications) in big tech or dream companies.

Then, when I interact with other people, very often, I feel and notice that I'm much "ahead" / smarter / on top of things than them, because, for example, I'm not only vertically focused on tech in IT but also in psychology or economics & content creation.

And precisely because of this, the dilemma arises: "But if I focused solely on one subject, how good could I become?" I just don't want to give up and abandon other interests that attract me.


## How Can You brake This Thought?
It's truly an incredible loop, but I think the only thing I can do right now is to continue studying/educating myself as much as possible so as NOT to have regrets (or at least minimize them) and to be able to create the best possible future (given my starting point).

PS: I think this last aside I added about one's origins is CRUCIAL because everyone plays THEIR OWN GAME and not that of others... and this is precisely where we, as human beings, make mistakes and allow ourselves to be influenced by social comparison.
