I remember it as if it were today... I was in my exam session, my last session before graduating in computer science in Verona, and it was the end of June.

My girlfriend's birthday was coming up, so I decided to treat her to a mini 5-day vacation in Riccione.

When I was organizing everything, I relied not only on the web but also on a friend of mine who spends months there, asking him to recommend a nice place to stay. And so the suggestion arrived... he described it as a spectacular place:
- Super clean hotel
- Staff extremely kind and always available
- Family-run
- The food is something spectacular (and the person who told me this is a chef)
- Parking (paid, yes, but private and considering we are 50 meters from the beach)

Well, I didn't hesitate at all... I wanted the contact details immediately.
Luckily, he was right there in Riccione, so he went directly to the reception to see if there was room, and he told me there was and that we could go if we wanted.

So I started an online search to verify everything he told me (even though I trust him blindly). However, I noticed a "nasty" surprise, namely that the hotel had only 2 stars.
So I checked and double-checked if it was exactly the hotel he was talking about, and it was indeed that one.

I struggled for a few days because I wanted only the best for my girlfriend (as much as I could financially, being that I am still studying). To be honest, I was even ashamed to think that I was taking her to a 2-star hotel, and in fact, I must say that until we arrived and had proof that everything my friend Matteo had said was true, let's say I was tense because I didn't want to look bad and I wanted everything to be perfect.

As you may have understood, I trusted him... I went to this 2-star hotel, we had a divine time, and it was a "romantic getaway" that, although specific/short, was unforgettable and indescribable, and I will always carry it in my heart.

Certainly, I would never have considered that hotel... and I was totally wrong. It is from here that I understand the importance of human value and not just the fact: "I have the internet and I can check and verify everything" because often online there are biases that divert us to other choices (and often they are not the right ones, or at least the optimal ones).

For the curious ones, well... Here is the playlist of our VLOGs during this mini romantic getaway
