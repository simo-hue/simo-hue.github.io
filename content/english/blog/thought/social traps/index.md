# Detached from stimuli

We live in an age of constant stimulation, a constant flow of notifications, updates and digital content that keep us constantly "connected" but, at the same time, drastically reduce our ability to concentrate. Every day, we are bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli through social media, messaging apps, entertainment platforms, which now guide our lives both online and offline.

## The Loss of Attention Span

This situation scares me. I have noticed, especially during the pandemic, how much social media has taken on the role of "directors" of our lives. People talk about news, trends, and aspects of other people's lives that they have learned on social media, as if these have replaced real experiences. Our attention span has reduced to almost absurd levels: we are incapable of standing in line or waiting without taking out our phones in search of new stimuli. This constant search for instant gratification through digital devices deprives us of the ability to fully live in the moment.

## An Incredibly Addicted Generation

There is a big difference compared to when I was a child. I remember with nostalgia the time spent playing outside, running in the parks and socializing with friends. Now I see parents who have to force their children to go out because, as soon as they can, young people prefer to stay sunk on the couch, immersed in devices. This cultural change is fueled by social media, which offers continuous doses of dopamine pleasure, generating an addiction similar to that of chemical substances.

## First Step: Awareness

The first step to free ourselves from this trap is to gain awareness. It is essential to understand how much social media and digital devices can suck us into their network, distancing us from real life and its most natural and authentic stimuli. If not managed with awareness, these tools can make us slaves to a virtual reality, making us lose connection with ourselves and with others in real life.

## The Importance of Being Bored

Being bored has become almost a taboo in modern society, but it is a practice that brings incredible benefits. Being bored is an opportunity to reflect, to let your mind wander and to reconnect with your creativity. It is a state that can bring out deep thoughts and new ideas, a precious space in which the mind frees itself from incessant stimuli and learns to regenerate itself. Learning to enjoy the absence of stimuli is essential to regaining our attention and living a more balanced life.

So, the next time you feel the temptation to grab your phone during a break, try to resist. Let your mind free itself from the need for constant stimuli, embrace boredom and allow yourself to return to a more natural rhythm. This is the only way we can escape the "Social Trap" and regain our mental freedom.
