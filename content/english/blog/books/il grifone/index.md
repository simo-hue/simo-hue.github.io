## Introduction
*Il Grifone*, written by Nicola Gratteri, is a work that goes beyond the simple narration of the fight against organized crime. This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the 'ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).

## Book Summary
*Il Grifone* tells stories of corruption, organized crime and the constant challenge to defend the rule of law. Gratteri does not limit himself to describing the mechanisms of the 'ndrangheta: he also illustrates the strategies to fight it, highlighting the importance of a strong, cohesive and determined judiciary.

The title of the book, symbolic and evocative, refers to a mythological creature that represents vigilance and strength: qualities that well describe Gratteri himself in his daily commitment.

## Nicola Gratteri: A Fascinating Comparison with Paolo Borsellino
Reading *Il Grifone* and listening to interviews with Nicola Gratteri, it is impossible not to notice a parallel with figures such as Paolo Borsellino. Like Borsellino, Gratteri has chosen to dedicate every aspect of his life to working for justice, sacrificing his personal life and giving up many privileges to remain faithful to his mission.

### Total Dedication
Nicola Gratteri lives under escort, constantly aware of the risks that his role entails. However, he does not seek recognition or indulgence: his commitment is driven by a deep moral conviction and the desire to leave a better world for future generations. This dedication leads him to give up a private life and those moments of normality that many of us take for granted.

### An Example of Sacrifice and Courage
Like Paolo Borsellino, Gratteri also demonstrates that justice is a value that requires absolute commitment. Both represent figures who put the collective good first, even at the cost of putting aside their own well-being and personal safety. This aspect makes their example not only admirable, but also deeply inspiring.

## Why *Il Grifone* is Important
This book is not only a work of denunciation, but also a reflection on how dedication and sacrifice are necessary to face seemingly insurmountable challenges. Gratteri not only describes the reality of organized crime, but invites us to reflect on the collective responsibility in building a more just society.

His dedication recalls that of Paolo Borsellino, becoming an example of sacrifice, courage and integrity. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the price and value of justice.
