## 🚀 Vision

I believe in continuous learning and the development of transversal skills that complement a technical profile.
Precisely for this reason, I also study and develop a passion for Marketing, Psychology, and many other subjects that aren't strictly related to my studies.

## 🏆 Goal
To build something **of my own**, become an entrepreneur, and create lasting value.

I don't see myself as a lifelong employee: I want to leave a mark and help as many people as possible.
