## Who is Simone Mattioli?

I'm Simone Mattioli, born on July 28, 2003, in Rovereto, Trentino-Alto Adige.
My life is driven by a great curiosity for technology, vehicles, and sports, combined with a desire to explore the world and continually learn.

## Academic and Professional Education

- Technical Diploma from ITT Marconi Rovereto (Computer Science)

## Vision

I believe in continuous learning and the development of transversal skills that complement a technical profile.
Precisely for this reason, I also study and develop a passion for Marketing, Psychology, and many other subjects that aren't strictly related to my studies.

## Goal
To build something **of my own**, become an entrepreneur, and create lasting value.

I don't see myself as a lifelong employee: I want to leave a mark and help as many people as possible.

- **Travel and Volunteering**
- **Content Creation**
- **Cars & Bikes**
- **Technology**
