# The legendary technology

I love it so much that now I hate it...

I still remember back in the days of my first nintendo 3ds when I played as a kid and then moved on to my first phone (samsung, around middle school) and from there the BOOM phone after phone then switching to my first iPhone (11 pro max) from the samsung galaxy s8 plus and from there the iPhone series until I got to my current one which is the 15 Pro Max that I think I'm among the few people who really exploits it for what it is...namely a PERFECT CAMERA to record CONTENT that we all carry in our pockets every day.

I certainly don't limit myself to smartphones, but also drones, stabilizers and action cams...and the list goes on.

## The Process

I said that now I hate it...but aren't we on the passions page? Why am I writing this thing in this category? Am I crazy? Yes, but in this case everything is correct...TRUST THE PROCESS.

What happened to me, as I think will have happened to so many kids (digital natives) is the fact that once you discover the phone it becomes difficult to detach yourself and do without it.

my big concern is for the generation that is growing up now, who are born with social media + AI, so they have never known the real world, and there is a risk that they will never know it at all because if already before with "only" social media everyone isolates themselves and no longer has fun meeting up at the soccer field, going biking (or any other activity that was done, or at least that I did with my friends) I dare not imagine what will happen with AI too.

I say this because it makes me very sad when on summer evenings I see the soccer field in val di rabbi always turned off and empty, when instead when I was young (I'm writing this when I'm 22 years old, and it really hurts to write these things) the only thing I wanted to do was eat dinner super fast because I had to run and go play at the field...
Maybe we didn't always play seriously, maybe we would do a "tedesca" and then sit in the middle of the field chatting, listening to music, playing truth or dare.

One might wonder...but if you liked it so much and it was normal to do it, why don't you go now with your crew? First of all good question, but the fact is very simple: there is NO crew anymore...
This is because there are those who isolate themselves in smartphones and technology and those who instead meet at the bar to drink (another nasty beast in small mountain villages).

## The Big Change

It came for me during COVID, when I spent an average of 15 hours a day (I'm not kidding) on instagram, played FORTNITE or messing around in other ways.

Just thinking about it makes me feel bad, but luckily I realized it now and I will never make this mistake again...that of throwing away the precious time (which is always too short, even if we don't know how much we have left) that life gives us.

I too, I admit, spent a lot of time playing both on PC and on MOBILE and I'm ashamed of my attitude...but reflecting on this unhealthy habit I decided to detach myself from all this and go in search of quality time.

## How I use it today

Now, yes there are social media...and I even have a "personal brand" about it that UNFORTUNATELY forces me to have those damn applications on my iPhone (which otherwise I would very gladly delete)...but I can't deny that having tried to delete them and do everything from the computer becomes really much more difficult and less productive because I end up wasting much more time for a task that could have taken me much less time.

So yes, I can keep them downloaded on the phone but because I have become aware and yes...it always happens that people make jokes/talk about trends and I have no idea and I always come across as that weird one who is out of the world and doesn't understand what people are doing.

On the other hand though I'm really happy because I have a screen time that is around an hour and a half (where most of the time is spent on whatsapp and on the camera) while on social media I probably spend about 5 minutes...I go in, I post, I get out!. Or alternatively: I go in, I schedule as much content as possible, I get out for a longer period and then I repeat the cycle to keep my personal brand active.

## Computer Science

It will also be because "for work" I'm always in front of a screen that I then understand how important it is to minimize as much as possible those digital distractions and keep everything as tidy as possible.

Or even from here the desire to disconnect from everything and everyone once I've closed the pc.

> it's a fantastic passion that makes you discover many things, YES! However, you have to be very careful that this passion doesn't become CARCINOGENIC.
