# My Beneficial Drug
It sounds bad, I know...but as a totally sober person who has never:
- drank
- smoked
- tried any type of drug

I can successfully state that I am totally addicted to cars and in case you didn't know me and a car I like passed by next to us you would say I have serious problems (and I'm aware of it).

All this doesn't matter to me though because even though I'm 22 and when a beautiful car passes by I behave like a child I'm not ashamed, not at all because mine is a passion to the nth power towards this sector.

## Not Just Main Stream Products
Easy to "adore" supercars like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Maserati, etc. but instead my passion goes much further...much further.
I don't care about the value of the car, but its characteristics. For example admiring brands such as ICH-X, Hyundai, Toyota, Pagani, Konigsegg, etc.

### Small example: 
> Last week I was in Maranello, surrounded by ferraris but I saw a hyundai i20n (cost around 20k) and I still stood there looking at it and took a photo of it because in my opinion, like the big sister (hyundai i30n) it's a great car...that sounds really good even if it doesn't have a v12

## The Goal and NOT The Dream
As said elsewhere on this site, I'm a very ambitious person...and yes, I like cars (often super expensive) but I never look at them with the eyes of a dreamer but with the eyes of someone who knows, that with many sacrifices and actions that 99% of people don't do it's possible to manage to own them and have them in your life.

> Of course I don't mean to say that 'I LIVE FOR THE CAR' in the sense that I save every single euro and as soon as I can I buy the dream car because it's not sustainable and above all it's not a smart thing (even though when I was little I kept supporting this idea of mine).

As said above, it's an expensive "vice", very expensive and for this reason before managing to "conquer" these cars all the other much more important parts of life must be resolved:
- health
- family
- financial independence

so that you can then start getting some "adult toys" and start having fun but with the economic possibility and with your back covered. Avoiding having to watch the consumption of my new big car that I can NOT afford though. (situation of 99% of people who show off to display the big car)

And speaking of show-offs, the thing that makes me understand the most how much I'm a passionate person, besides the fact that when I drive I get a smile and the whole world around me stops (almost as if problems disappeared and I enjoyed the drive as if it took me elsewhere) is the fact that I don't care about attracting attention, on the contrary...I like for example when kids tell me to rev the engine because I too found myself in their situation, but I still am for vehicles of a certain level like ferrari, audi rs, lambo, etc.

And this is the healthy attention, that is the sharing between enthusiasts and NOT showing off in front of the bar or in the town center passing by speeding to show off in front of other people.

> I feel a bit like Horacio Pagani (unlike that I haven't done anything extraordinary myself but whatever...) when he says that cars have a soul. When I stand there observing cars it seems to me I perceive it and even while I drive them I feel a sort of bidirectional communication with the vehicle I'm driving and I hope this thing can never ever change.

Now I have to go to work otherwise I'll never have the chance to have one of these cars...read you soon!
