# The Birth

I honestly don't know where this passion came from but I know I have it. It wasn't passed down from my parents, but something I developed on my own (but in my opinion it's all thanks to YouTube, a platform I fell in love with since I had access to it)

# Types of Creation

There are some contents, which I care about particularly, that I consider "WORK" and so I dedicate a lot of time to editing and writing the video but also others much more genuine that I record on the fly and don't even edit.

Here are my 2 examples

## Mountain & Fauna Lover

My "personal Brand" where I make videos dedicated to the mountains and activities connected to it. 

### Purpose

Sharing the beauties that I've been accustomed to since I was little (and that I therefore tend to take for granted) of val di rabbi, but in general of the mountains and all the connected activities.

So I create content to share and make people experience the emotions that I feel in the mountains even to people who don't have the possibility to be in these places.

### Type

There are yes some videos that don't require much work (the old ones), but now I want to raise the level more and more and for this reason now when I have to create a video I often get a stomach ache because I know there has to be quite a bit of work (and for the 10 euros a month that YouTube gives me I'm greatly decreasing the amount of time I dedicate to it because I have to focus on building my skills)


## Simo's Diary

Increase to the nth power the quality of my "JOURNALING". Where I make VLOGs of personal thoughts, successes and failures, fears and trips I take during my life.

### Purpose

If Mountain & Fauna Lover is made for others, this is made for me.

### Type

Editing equal to zero, sometimes in some videos yes there is but really super basic...little expense but great return to create digital memories that I can watch again whenever I want.


# The Usefulness

Yes sure, I also learn to edit...but above all I learn to speak better and better, listening to myself again and learning to improvise and so I'm really happy to have started creating content and going from consumer to producer.
