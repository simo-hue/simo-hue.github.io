# What Have I Done?
I've always been used to doing sports since I was little...I've tried a bit of everything:
- tennis (for about ten years)
- soccer (always and only in the village field)
- swimming (lasted very little, I even made a rhyme)
- handball (which I really liked)
- MMA (alongside weight training)
- Bike (first regular and then ebike)
- Mountain hikes
- Ski mountaineering and downhill


As you can understand, I don't miss out on anything and why not have other experiences about it?

# Why Do I Do It?

Well first of all because it makes me feel good both psychologically and physically.

Also I know that it's a good and right thing to keep your body in shape to age better and above all guarantee yourself a better quality of life.
