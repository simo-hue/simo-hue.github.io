I've always been a super curious and very ambitious guy...but theory alone does very little.

# Where Did It All Start?
As often happens, big changes occur during difficult periods and here I am right after being betrayed by my girlfriend finding myself semi desperate and without direction.

From here the desire for "revenge" and to show my value and what my ex girlfriend was losing. I started reading the classic books, buying courses and surrounding myself online only with people who would make me grow.

# The Burn Out
I became obsessed, I listened to "productive" material that would make me grow even at night because I went to sleep with headphones on or I put the macbook turned on on the nightstand
to go into "immersion" in the content and never detach myself.

# Result
Yes I changed, a lot and I must say MUCH MUCH better and I'm super happy and proud of myself for having done all this.

Now though I have to start rebuilding routines that I can maintain without falling into burn out again, otherwise I would waste more time in the "relax" phase post burn out instead of continuing to work on myself in a more continuous way.

# What Resources Do I Use?
- Books (a lot of friction because it's not always easy to sit down there, but it's a habit I'm trying to develop more and more)
- Courses, both Online and Physical (both free and paid)
- Podcasts (when I'm in the car)
- YouTube Videos (lots of quality material)

> If anyone else is passionate and has advice to give me...well make yourselves heard on linkedin, mail or on social media because I'm always very open to questioning myself.
