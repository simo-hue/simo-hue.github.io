## The Genesis of the Project: From Necessity to Solution

As a content creator managing the channel **Simo's Diary**, I faced a recurring challenge: reaching an international audience. My videos, initially conceived only in Italian, had the potential to appeal to people around the world, but the language barrier was a significant obstacle.

Looking at YouTube analytics, I noticed that many international users started watching my content but quickly abandoned it, likely due to the language barrier. It was clear that a solution was needed to make the content globally accessible.

## From Problem to Automated Solution

Manually translating titles, descriptions, and subtitles for each video into multiple languages ‚Äã‚Äãwould have been an extremely time-consuming and expensive process. I therefore decided to develop an automated solution that could:

1. Automatically translate titles and descriptions
2. Manage subtitles in multiple languages
3. Optimize workflows for content creators
4. Drastically reduce localization times

## Advanced Technical Features
