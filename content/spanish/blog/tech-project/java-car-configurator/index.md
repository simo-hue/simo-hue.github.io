## The Genesis of the Project: From Academic Need to Technical Excellence

The **Programming 2** exam at the University of Verona represents a pivotal moment in the Computer Science curriculum: the transition from procedural programming to advanced object-oriented paradigms. When I was assigned the project to develop a modular and extensible product configurator, I saw the perfect opportunity to demonstrate my mastery of fundamental software engineering principles.

The goal was ambitious: to create a system that didn't simply function, but exemplified **best practices** in **software architecture**, **design patterns**, and **maintainable code**â€”principles that characterize quality enterprise software.

## From Idea to Implementation: A Scalable Modular System

The main challenge was not just to develop a configurator, but to design it with a modular architecture that would allow:
- Extensibility without changes to the core system
- Maintainability through separation of concerns
- Testability via design for automated testing
- Scalability to support complex products

I chose to focus on a car configurator because it represents a complex domain with:
- Multiple interdependent options (engine, interior, exterior)
- Sophisticated configuration constraints
- Dynamic pricing based on user selections
- Intuitive user experience despite the complexity

## Software Architecture and Design Patterns

### MVC Architecture Implementation
The implementation strictly follows the Model-View-Controller pattern:

#### ðŸ“Š Model Layer - Business Logic Core
```java
// Configuration state management and business rules
- Product and option representation Configurable
- Validation logic for valid combinations
- Pricing engine for dynamic cost calculations
- Data persistence for saving configurations
```

#### ðŸŽ¨ View Layer - JavaFX User Interface
- Responsive GUI with JavaFX for optimal user interaction
- Component-based design for reusable UI elements
- Event-driven interface for real-time configuration updates
- Accessibility features for user inclusiveness

#### ðŸŽ® Controller Layer - Interaction Management
- Sophisticated event handling for user interactions
- State synchronization between model and view layers
- Validation orchestration for user input
- Navigation flow management for a seamless user experience

### Advanced Design Patterns Used

#### Factory Pattern for Product Creation
- Configurator Factory for instantiating configurable products
- Option Factory for creating modular components
- Abstract Factory for related product families
- Extensibility for new product types without code changes

#### Observer Pattern for Real-time Updates
- Configuration Observer for monitoring state changes
- Price Observer for real-time cost updates
- UI Observer for synchronizing interface elements
- Decoupled communication between system components

## Technology Stack and Enterprise Tools

### Core Technologies
- Java 17+: Core language for robustness and performance
- JavaFX: Modern GUI framework for desktop applications
- JUnit: Testing framework for comprehensive automated testing
- Maven/Gradle: Build automation for dependency management

### Development Environment
- IntelliJ IDEA: Professional IDE for maximum productivity
- Git Version Control: Source control for collaborative development
- Code Quality Tools: Checkstyle, PMD for code standards
- Documentation: Javadoc for complete API documentation

## Modular Structure and Code Organization

### Package Strategic Architecture
```
src/main/java/
â”œâ”€â”€ controller/ # Event management and user interactions
â”œâ”€â”€ model/ # Business logic and data representations
â”œâ”€â”€ view/ # JavaFX UI components and layouts
â”œâ”€â”€ exceptions/ # Custom exception handling
â””â”€â”€ utility/ # Support classes and helper methods
```

### Separation of Concerns Benefits
- **Independent development** of different layers
- **Testing isolation** for effective unit testing
- **Code reusability** through modular components
- **Maintenance efficiency** via clear responsibilities

## Advanced Configurator Features

### Sophisticated Configuration Engine
- **Multi-step wizard** for guided configuration experience
- Automatic **Dependency resolution** for related options
- **Conflict detection** and resolution suggestions
- **Real-time validation** with immediate feedback

### Dynamic Pricing System
- **Base price calculation** with option premiums
- **Discount rules** for package combinations
- Regionalized **Tax calculation**
- **Export quotation** in multiple formats

### Advanced Data Management
- **Configuration persistence** for session recovery
- **Export/Import** customized configurations
- **History tracking** for previous configurations
- **Template system** for predefined configurations

## Team Development and Collaboration

### Collaborative Development Approach
**Team Members:**
- **Simone Mattioli**: Lead Developer and Architecture Design
- **David Cavada**: UI/UX Development and Testing
- **Omar Bodio**: Business Logic and Data Management

### Professional Development Practices
- Systematic **Code reviews** for quality assurance
- **Git workflow** with feature branches and pull requests
- **Documentation standards** for knowledge sharing
- **Testing strategy** coordinated for complete coverage

## Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Each component model tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Interaction between layers verified
- **UI Tests**: User interface behavior validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for scalability

### Code Quality Metrics
- Test Coverage: >90% for critical business logic
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Maintained below enterprise thresholds
- Code Duplication: Minimized through systematic refactoring
- Documentation Coverage: Complete Javadoc for public APIs
