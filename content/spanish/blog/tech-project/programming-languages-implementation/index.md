## The Genesis of the Project: From Abstraction to Concrete Implementation

The **Programming Languages** course at the University of Verona represents one of the most fascinating moments of the Computer Science curriculum: the moment when one moves from the **use** of languages â€‹â€‹to their **creation**. When the professor announced the lab projectâ€”implementing a programming language from scratchâ€”I saw the perfect opportunity to combine theoretical passion and practical application.

The challenge was ambitious: not only to understand the internal mechanisms of parsing, interpretation, and execution, but to **concretely implement** them, creating a working language that could also be useful to my colleagues as a study reference.

## From Concept to Community: Sharing to Grow Together

As with my previous projects, I immediately thought about how this work could **benefit the entire student community**. Implementing a programming language is a complex task that many students find intimidating, especially when dealing with:

- **Lexical analysis** and syntax
- **Abstract syntax trees**
- **Memory management** and scope management
- **Runtime error handling**
- **Integrating different paradigms**

I therefore decided to document every aspect of the process, creating a resource that could guide other students through the complexities of implementation.

## MyLang Architecture and Design

### Core Technology Stack
- **Java**: Host language for robustness and portability
- **ANTLR4**: Parser generator for managing complex grammars
- **Visitor Pattern**: For AST traversal and interpretation
- **Exception Handling**: For elegant runtime error handling

### Innovative Language Features

#### ðŸ§  Dynamic Type System
- **Multi-type support**: integers, floats, strings, arrays
- **Intelligent type coercion** for mixed operations
- **Runtime type checking** with detailed error reporting
- **Automatic memory management** for data structures

#### ðŸ”„ Advanced Scope Management
- **Dynamic scoping** with call stack management
- **Lexical scoping** for variable shadowing
- **Independent environments** for functions
- **Global variable synchronization** controlled

#### âš¡ Extended Control Constructs
- **Standard control flow**: if/else, while, for loops
- **Non-deterministic execution**: unique construct for algorithmic exploration
- **Function declaration** without parameters for simplicity
- **Return mechanism** via exception handling for control flow

## Distinctive Technical Innovations

### Native Brainfuck Integration
One of the most interesting features of MyLang is the **complete integration of the Brainfuck language**, allowing:
- **Native execution** of Brainfuck code within MyLang
- **Interoperability** between the two paradigms
- **Educational value** for understanding esoteric languages
- **Demonstration of flexibility** of interpreter architecture

### Parser Generation with ANTLR4
The use of **ANTLR4** for automatic parser generation demonstrates:
- **Grammar-driven development** for formal languages
- **Separation of concerns** between syntax and semantics
- **Maintainable codebase** through grammatical declarations
- **Professional tooling** for language development

## Implementation of Core Components

### Automated Lexers and Parsers
```java
// Automatic generation from ANTLR4 grammar
@Override
public Value visitProg(MyLangParser.ProgContext ctx) {
return visitChildren(ctx);
}
```

### Evaluation Visitor Pattern
- Systematic AST Traversal for interpretation
- Type safety through Value wrapper classes
- Controlled error propagation via exceptions
- State management for execution context

### Advanced Memory Model
- Stack-based scoping for function management
- Heap allocation for dynamic data structures
- Implicit garbage collection via Java runtime
- Automatic variable lifecycle management

## Educational Impact and Community Value

### Comprehensive Educational Resources
The project provides:
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Extensive code comments for each component
- Architecture documentation for design decisions
- Comprehensive test cases for validation

### Reference Implementation
- Best practices for language implementation
- Design patterns applied to compiler construction
- Error handling strategies for production quality
- Performance considerations for Interpreter Optimization

## Design Choice Analysis

### Scoping Strategy: Dynamic vs. Lexical
The choice to implement dynamic scoping as the default with lexical support demonstrates:
- Flexibility in exploring different paradigms
- Educational value in understanding trade-offs
- Elegantly managed implementation complexity
- Predictable and debuggable runtime behavior

### Exception-Based Return Mechanismsm
The use of Java exceptions to implement return statements demonstrates:
- Creative problem solving for language features
- Leveraging host language capabilities
- Clean control flow management
- Well-documented performance implications

## Development and Testing Methodology

### Incremental Development
- Feature-driven implementation with continuous testing
- Modular architecture for parallel component development
- Version control for tracking language evolution
- Documentation parallel to code development

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each individual component
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Error condition testing for robustness
- Performance benchmarking for optimization

## Contribution to Computer Science Education

### Democratizing Language Implementation
The project demonstrates that language implementation is not the exclusive prerogative of advanced computer scientists, but can be:
- Accessible to Undergraduate students with a systematic approach
- **Educational** to understand fundamental principles
- **Practical** to develop implementation skills
- **Collaborative** through code and documentation sharing

### Bridge Between Theory and Practice
MyLang serves as a **concrete** bridge between:
- **Formal language theory** and real-world implementation
- **Abstract concepts** of parsing and concrete execution
- **Academic knowledge** and industry-relevant skills
- **Individual learning** and community contribution

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

### Language Design Principles
- **Simplicity** as a foundation for understandability
- **Syntactic consistency** for user experience
- **Architectural extensibility** for future evolution
- **Informative error messages** for effective debugging

### Implementation Strategies
- **Tool selection** appropriate for problem complexity
- **Incremental complexity** for development management
- **Documentation-driven** development for maintainability
- Community feedback integration for continuous improvement

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

### Planned Language Features
- More sophisticated type system with inference
- Module system for code organization
- Standard library for common functionality
- Just-in-Time compilation for performance improvements

### Educational Expansion
- Interactive tutorials for language features
- Visual debugger for execution tracing
- Comparative analysis with other languages
- Workshop materials for teaching compiler construction

## A Model for Collaborative Learning

This project exemplifies how individual academic excellence can be transformed into a collective resource through:
- Open source mindset from inception
- Documentation excellence for knowledge transfer
- Community engagement for feedback and improvements
- Educational impact that goes beyond a single course

## Conclusions: From Implementation To Inspiration

MyLang represents more than just a university project: it is a concrete demonstration that the complexity of programming language implementation can be demystified through a systematic approach, excellent documentation, and a spirit of sharing.

The project continues to serve the UniVR student community as a reference implementation and learning resource, demonstrating that investing in quality and documentation yields lasting benefits for entire generations of students.
