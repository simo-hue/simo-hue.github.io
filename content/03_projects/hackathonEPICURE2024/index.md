The **EPICURE Hackathon**, held from October 28-31, 2024, brought together developers, researchers, and enthusiasts from across Europe to dive deep into the world of **GPU programming and high-performance computing (HPC)**. This event was hosted in collaboration with **CINECA**, one of the leading HPC centers in Europe, renowned for its contributions to scientific computing and advanced research.

The hackathon was meticulously structured, featuring both hands-on labs and theoretical sessions, designed to empower participants with the latest skills in **CUDA programming**, **OpenACC**, and **GPU optimization techniques**.

## Day 1: Getting Started with GPU Computing

The first day served as an introduction to GPU computing, aimed at setting a strong foundation. Topics included:
- **Introduction to GPU Computing:** A look into the architecture and advantages of using GPUs for high-performance tasks.
- **CUDA Basics:** Practical insights into CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform, providing a gateway to harnessing the power of GPU cores.

The agenda for Day 1 was as follows:
  
| Time          | Session |
|---------------|---------|
| 9:00 - 9:15   | Welcome and Registration |
| 9:15 - 9:30   | EPICURE HPC Application Support for EuroHPC Users |
| 9:30 - 10:30  | Introduction to GPU Computing |
| 10:30 - 11:00 | Coffee Break |
| 11:00 - 12:30 | Introduction to CUDA |
| 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch |
| 14:00 - 15:30 | OpenACC Programming and Profiling with Nsight |
| 15:30 - 16:00 | Coffee Break |
| 16:00 - 17:30 | OpenACC Programming and Profiling with Nsight |

## Day 2: Advanced GPU Optimization and Profiling

Day 2 took things to the next level, focusing on **advanced GPU optimization and profiling techniques**. Participants were guided through various optimization methods to fine-tune GPU applications, reducing computation time and maximizing efficiency.

| Time          | Session |
|---------------|---------|
| 9:00 - 10:30  | Advanced GPU Optimization and Profiling |
| 10:30 - 11:00 | Coffee Break |
| 11:00 - 12:30 | Advanced GPU Optimization and Profiling (Continued) |
| 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch |
| 14:00 - 17:30 | Lab Session (with your code or a provided code) |

The hands-on lab in the afternoon provided an opportunity to implement what we learned using real-world examples, supported by the CINECA team.

## Day 3-4: Intensive Lab Sessions

The last two days were dedicated to **intensive lab sessions**. Participants worked on challenging GPU computing projects, with mentors available to provide guidance and feedback. These sessions enabled us to:
- Test and debug our code using real-time feedback from experts.
- Engage in peer-to-peer learning, exchanging ideas and optimizing our implementations.
- Utilize **Nsight** and other profiling tools to analyze performance and identify bottlenecks.

| Date       | Morning (9:00 - 12:30) | Afternoon (14:00 - 17:30) |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| October 30 | Lab Session             | Lab Session                |
| October 31 | Lab Session             | Lab Session                |
