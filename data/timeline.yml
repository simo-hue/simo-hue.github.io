      At the University of Verona, I specialized in computer science while living at Collegio Don Mazza, a merit-based university residence that fostered academic excellence and personal growth. Meanwhile I developed my deep interest for Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance Computing.
      
      My university journey culminated in my thesis project on Leonardo HPC at CINECA, where I developed an LLM-based system to predict the next tourist attraction within the city of Verona. This research combined machine learning with high-performance computing on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, resulting in my first academic publication.
      
      The project achieved significant improvements in tourism flow prediction accuracy and demonstrated the potential of combining Large Language Models with HPC infrastructure for real-world applications.
    achievements:
      - "Resident at Collegio Don Mazza (merit-based university residence)"
      - "Specialized in Computer Science"
      - "Developed thesis project on Leonardo HPC at CINECA"
      - "Published first academic paper on tourism prediction using LLMs"
      - "Worked with NVIDIA A100 GPUs for large-scale machine learning"

      A digital extension of my daily journaling habit on paper. On YouTube, I share:
      • genuine, unedited moments
      • no complex storytelling
      • no elaborate editing
      • just pure emotions and transparency
      
      These vlogs are my way of preserving raw, authentic memories that I can revisit in the future. From life reflections to adventures, every video is a snapshot of real experiences, keeping the same honest spirit of my handwritten journal but in a format I can relive visually years from now.

      A wildlife photography and videography project focused on alpine fauna. Using professional Swarovski Optik equipment, I capture intimate moments of mountain animals—from ibex and chamois to marmots and eagles—in their natural habitat.
      
      The project spans Instagram for photography, YouTube for documentary-style content, and TikTok for short-form wildlife stories. 
      
      My goal is simple: share the beauty of these incredible creatures and the mountain landscapes that house them.
    achievements:
      - "Partnership with SWAROVSKI OPTIK for wildlife equipment"
      - "Documented rare alpine species in their natural habitat"
      - "Built engaged community across Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok"
      - "Featured in exclusive wildlife events and collaborations"

      **Born and raised in the mountains of Trentino-Alto Adige, the outdoors has always been my sanctuary. Year after year, my passion for hiking, skiing, and exploring mountain landscapes evolved into something bigger: the Mountain & Fauna Lover project.
      
      What started almost as a joke became a platform to share my love for alpine wildlife and nature photography. Through Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, I document wildlife encounters, mountain adventures, and the beauty of the natural world. This passion even led to collaborations with companies like SWAROVSKI OPTIK.
      
      The mountains aren't just where I recharge—they're where I discovered my purpose: celebrating and protecting the wild places and creatures that inspire me every day.
    achievements:
      - "Created and grew Mountain & Fauna Lover across social platforms"
      - "Collaborated with SWAROVSKI OPTIK for wildlife content"
